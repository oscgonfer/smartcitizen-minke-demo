# Welcome!

This template will guide you through the process of documenting your project during the [MINKE](https://minke.eu) TNA open calls. This is also meant to be a template for hosting your project legacy, or a place for all the documentation of your project to be stored in. It will include data, conclusions and _soft_ documentation, such as experiences, advice on how to use the sensors, or anything you want to document and share with others.

Ideally, you would use this template to document:

- What your project is about, and what you will do in it
- Sensor setup
- Data collection (referencing the data in [zenodo](https://zenodo.org))
- Analysis, and conclusions

All this, using open tools, keeping track of where data is, and hopefully, in the future, your project will inspire others. To summarize:

- Project details will be in a website like what you are seeing, following the [project template](project)
- Code and analysis is posted on a (by default) Github repository, forked from the [MINKE Template](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-minke-template). Follow the [setup](setup) guide and the [jupyter example](notebook)
- Data will be hosted in Zenodo, after using the [scdata zenodo example](https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Guides/data/Upload%20data%20to%20zenodo/)
- Projects will be linked in [the index](https://participatory-tech.docs.minke.eu/Projects/)
